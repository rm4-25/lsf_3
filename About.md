## About Listening in/to South Florida (LSF)
- LSF is a Digital Enviornmnetal Humanities (DEH/DH hereafter) project because it invites the public to engage with their relationship to their environment through sound, whereby they add their narrative amidst climate crises. Creators are aware of the potential for a project like this to be greenwashed--or overwritten with those "ideal" natural sounds and pure immersion in forest bathing or some other obscurity. LSF project is not that. We are encouraging visitors and soundcatchers to engage with sounds as they blend in urban, elemental, and animal soundscapes to show just how interactive and ubiquitous those sounds are.

## Acknowledgements
The LSF Project originates from the University of Miami as part of Dr. Kelly Baker-Joseph's graduate Practicum in Digital Humanities (ENG 613/MLL 774). The LSF Team are doctoral students from the Modern Language and Literature and English and Creating Writing departments. We are grateful for Dr. Josephs' weekly guidance in digital and non-digital matters as we found our footing through the project's intial phases. We are also thankful to PhD Candidate Michael Soriano who visited our class to share his experiences with [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/), a philosophy of computing that emphasizes accessibility and shareability.  In this same visit, we  discussed Digital Humanities scholar Alex Gil whose open source [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme ["Ed"](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) we selected as our site theme. We are also grateful for the Digital Humanities Independent Research Group members Euge Stomm and Elizabeth Cornick for introducing us to Leaflet at one of their semester workshops. [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source platform created in Ukraniane.
