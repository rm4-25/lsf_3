## Acknowledgements
The LSF Project's creation began as part of Dr. Kelly Baker-Joseph's ENG 613/MLL 774 Practicum in Digital Humanities. The LSF Team is grateful for Dr. Josephs' weekly guidance in digital and non-digital matters as we found our footing through the project's intial phases. We are also thankful to Michael Soriano who visited our class to share his experiences with [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/), a philosophy of computing that emphasizes accessibility and shareability.  In this same visit, we  discussed Digital Humanities scholar Alex Gil, whose open source [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme ["Ed"](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) we selected as our site theme. We are also grateful for the Digital Humanities Independent Research Group members Euge Stomm and Elizabeth Cornick for introducing us to Leaflet at one of their semester workshops. Leaflet is a open-source platform created in Ukraniane.
