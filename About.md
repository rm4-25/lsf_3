## Acknowledgements
The LSF Project originates from the University of Miami (UM) as part of Dr. Kelly Baker-Joseph's graduate Practicum in Digital Humanities (ENG 613/MLL 774). The LSF Team are doctoral students from the Modern Languages and Literature and English and Creating Writing departments. We are grateful for Dr. Josephs' weekly guidance in digital and non-digital matters as we found our footing through the project's intial phases. Dr. Larissa Montas Bravo, GIS Librarian for Instruction at UM, assisted the LSF team in exploring alternative mapping options that enriched our project and provided a variety to our data visualization. We are also thankful to PhD Candidate Michael Soriano who visited our class to share his experiences with [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/), a philosophy of computing that emphasizes accessibility, shareability, and ease of use.  In this same visit, we  discussed Digital Humanities scholar Alex Gil whose open source [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme ["Ed"](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) we selected as our site theme. We are greatly appreciative for the Digital Humanities Independent Research Group members Euge Stomm and Elizabeth Cornick for introducing us to the open-source mapping tool based and developed in Ukraine named [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
