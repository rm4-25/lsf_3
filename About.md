## Acknowledgements
The LSF Project's creation began as part of Dr. Kelly Baker-Joseph's ENG 613/MLL 774 Practicum in Digital Humanities. The LSF Team is grateful for Dr. Josephs weekly guidance in digital and non-digital matters as we found our footing through the project's intial phases. We are also indebted to Michael Soriano who visited our class to share his experiences with minimal computing, a theory he sees as a practical pillar to his own journey in the digital humanities. In this same visit, we also learned of Alex Gil whose open source Jekyll theme "Ed" we would later adapt for our project. We are also grateful for the Digital Humanities Independent Research Group members Euge Stomm and Elizabeth Cornick for introducing us to the open source platform, Leaflet, as part of one of their semester workshops. Leaflet is a platform created and maintained by Ukranians, and we are happy to show solidarity with Ukraine through our map marker color scheme. Thank you.
