**Soundcatcher Statements, Experiences, Reflections**

"The act of recording the intermittent chirp or crow amidst the bustling noise of regular human activity helped me realize that these two sounds are never competing, but that they are, in fact, creating a unified chorus. Now, I see listening itself as an opportunity to attune to completely new ways of being." - Raul
